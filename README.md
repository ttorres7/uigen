# UIGen

UIGen is an AI-powered React component generator that lets you build UI components through a conversational chat interface. Simply describe the component you want, and Claude AI will generate it instantly — complete with a live preview rendered in a sandboxed iframe. No files are ever written to disk; everything runs in an in-memory virtual file system, making iteration fast and effortless.

Whether you're prototyping a new design, exploring UI ideas, or learning React, UIGen accelerates your workflow by turning natural language descriptions into production-ready components with Tailwind CSS styling.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Setup

1. **Optional** Edit `.env` and add your Anthropic API key:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

The project will run without an API key. Rather than using a LLM to generate components, static code will be returned instead.

2. Install dependencies and initialize database

```bash
npm run setup
```

This command will:

- Install all dependencies
- Generate Prisma client
- Run database migrations

## Running the Application

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage
